            <h4 class="card-title">Akaza</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Akaza (猗あ窩か座ざ Akaza?) was a member of the Twelve Demon Moons, holding the position of Upper Moon Three.[2] While he was human, his name was Hakuji.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5><b>Appearance</b></h5>
            <p>Demon - Pink hair and eyelashes, yellow eyes, blue marking all over his body, pale/white skin </p>
            <p>Human - Black hair, blueish eyelashes, blueish eyes, with three black lines on each arm (criminal marks for Theft)</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5><b>Personality</b></h5>
            <p>Akaza is a strong, stubborn and impulsive demon who enjoys fighting, especially strong demon hunters or Pillars. He looks down anybody that he deems as weak but shows genuine respect for those who are strong - regardless of race - in his eyes. He is also easily angered and annoyed especially by the whims of Doma and due to his past he has a deep loathing and hatred for weak people,who in his opinion always go for the most cowardly approach during any confrontation. Due to the tragic events of his human life,Akaze has a deep rooted psychological need to become stronger and despite being beaten down and defeated constantly he stubbornly held on and continued to fight,despite not even knowing why he continued to want more power.</p>
            <p>As a human, Hakuji possessed the same stubborn personality with a big heart and resilience. He valued others more than his own well-being and to a degree feels self-deprecation from having a life full of empty words and promises.</p>
            <p>Certain aspects of Hakuji's personality are displayed in Akaza as when he refused to eat women, despite knowing it would make him stronger if he did so.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5><b>History</b></h5>
            <p>Prior to being turned into a demon by Kibutsuji Muzan, he was Hakuji. He was born with fangs and thus was termed as a "Demon Child". He was born and raised in the slums. He had been taking care of his sickly father for a long time since he was young. In order to pay for medicine, he would go out in town to pickpocket, he was caught three times (each time he was caught, he was branded with a pickpocket mark). This would get him beatings from the magistrate with the threat of getting his hands cut if he stole again, but he nonetheless continued to steal until his father hung himself. In the letter he left, he stated he wanted Hakuji to live a full life and didn't want to take any medicine if it was the result of stealing.</p>

   <p>Now inked into his wrists where the triple band of a criminal signifying that he has committed his third and final offense, Hakuji was eventually banished from Edo, and in his rage he picked fights with people and beat them up, and that was when he met Keizou, the owner of a dojo with no students. Hakuji challenged him to a fight, but Keizo defeated him with ease. He then decided to take Hakuji under his wing so he could nurse Koyuki, Keizou's sickly daughter, after her previous caretaker (her mother) drowned herself due to stress. Hakuji ended up tending to Koyuki and indirectly motivated her by telling her that "there will be a next year" to see the fireworks. Three years later, she was in good health and could stand and do chores. In addition, he also trained as Keizou's pupil of the Soryu style, which healed his soul.</p>
            <p>Eventually, Keizou asked Hakuji to take over the dojo as well as taking Koyuki as a bride, to his surprise and embarrassment, he agreed to, vowing to himself that he would have two people to protect, even at the cost of his own life. At a festival, Koyuki told him of her past, asking if he was really okay with the proposal, to which he reaffirmed his vows to her, promising to protect her for the rest of his life.</p>
            <p>However, on taking a short trip to visit the grave of his deceased father to inform him of his marriage, on his return, he saw people outside his home and immediately knew something was wrong. He was then informed that someone had poisoned the well from where Koyuki and Keizou drank water from, and that they were both dead, and assumed it to be the work of the nearby kenjutsu dojo who were never able to defeat Keizou or Hakuji.</p>
            <p>Enraged, Hakuji went to that dojo and killed all sixty-seven members there with his bare hands, pulverising them to the point where almost all of the corpses were no longer recognisable in their original form. This incident caught Muzan's attention, wondering if a demon committed the massacre, disappointed to find out that it was but a human, Hakuji told him to move, but Muzan stabbed his face with his hand and gave him his blood, telling him that he intends to create 12 powerful demons , thus turning Hakuji, into the demon and one of the first members of the 12 Demon Moons known as Akaza.</p>
            <p>Over the centuries, he lost his memories of the time he became a human, with only one single desire to become stronger despite not knowing the reason why he wanted to become strong. Also, as noted by Douma, he refused to ever eat women. Also, he was dispatched by Muzan for special missions only (such as searching for the Blue Spider Lily).</p>

            <h5><b>Where did i make this Website?</b></h5>
            <p>Hi, my name is John Mark Lising from Nueva Ecija University in Science and Technology. I'm currently studying as a database programmer and i know Java Programming. I was assigned as a student body for the excange students in Indonesia and because of that i was able to have the opportunity for internship at Favorite Medium company.</p>
            <p>
              I'm amazed that there's an International programming company here in Cabanatuan. At first, they introduced us to their workmates, Sir Boinx as their System Analyst. He started giving us a website that'll teach us web programming. No way, i said in my mind. Because I'm a Java programmer and I'm nervous cos that's a different language. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But in the website that they give us. It teaches the basics of html. I was like, Okay that good. We continued the bootcamp, learning the basics. I was amazed. i really do understand html programming here. I was taught the basics of html language in school but I'm pretty sure i really don't understand the codes. But it differs here, i know how the program works. Every single code. So Sir Boinx gave us a task, to make a website. I was hesitating. Can i do it? Will i be a laughstock here? Well whatever, since they teach us whenever we have problems or questions. I know i'll manage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Day two of the Internship. I finished the bootcamp. So i proceeded to making my website. It was a simple website. Just a picture of an anime character with her information. I continued. Then Sir Boinx taught me the purpose of bootstrap. It is used so that the website can be accessed through different sized devices. Now i know the purpose of that. Then he sent us the video link for the tutorial. Since i was in intership, i felt like i need to do what he says.
            </p>
            <p>
              I studied the bootstrap. It is beautiful yet complicated but i was challenged. I know in the IT world, you need knowledge and experience to battle through this huge community. Made up my mind. I'll make a website.
            </p>
            <p>
              I deleted the old webpage that i made since i realized that my webpage is trash as soon as i learn about bootstrap. I started thinking, what should i make? I figured that making a website using only few characters is not enough. So I decided to make a website for that anime. I started searching for informations about the anime. I found a wiki website which contains most of all information about that anime. I'll make something like this cos its cool and i think it's pretty doable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Day after day i am excited to go here. To study, to learn, for the Wifi. I was so motivated that even if I'm at home, I'm still continuing my website. Because i wanna impress them and i want to make something good so that the Project Manager from Singapore won't be disappointed. I continued making the website. Whenever i had problems, my seniors are here to help and guide me. I'm very thankful for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Right now, I'm making this last webpage since i already completed the website based on what i learned. I want to learn more. I want to make good websites. But the timespan isn't enough. I hope i can do my OJT here at Favorite Medium. 
            </p>

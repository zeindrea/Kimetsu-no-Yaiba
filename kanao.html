        <div class="col-sm">
         <div class="col">

          <div class= "card-body text-center">
            <h4 class="card-title">Kanao Tsuyuri</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Kanao Tsuyuri (栗つ花ゆ落りカナヲ Tsuyuri Kanao?) is a Demon Slayer, Kanae Kocho and Shinobu Kocho's adoptive younger sister, and Shinobu's Tsuguko.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5><b>Appearance</b></h5>
            <p>Kanao is a girl of short stature, with large eyes and long black hair tied into a side ponytail, tied a butterfly ornament similar to Shinobu's. She wears the standard Demon Hunter uniform with a long pleated skirt instead of a hakama, and white laced up boots. Kanao also wears a white cloak with an ornament attached on the side.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5><b>Personality</b></h5>
            <p>At her introduction, Kanao is an indecisive and quiet girl. Because of the abuse she endured before meeting the Kocho sisters, she became unable to make decisions for herself and repressed her emotions as a defense mechanism. To help rectify this, Kanae gave her a coin to flip, to decide which fate she must foresee.</p>
            <p>Between Kanae's death and the Functional Recovery Training Arc, she recovers slightly, but still relies on her coin to make decisions. She displays a somewhat mechanical response in conversations; when Tanjiro Kamado approaches her to bid her farewell, she repeats "Goodbye" when he attempts to continue the conversation. Eventually, however, he manages to start bringing her out of her shell, and she starts to make her own decisions.</p>
            <p>In her battle against Doma, Kanao takes uncharacteristically sadistic glee in pointing out his own lack of emotions. Fueled by hatred and spite towards her sisters' deaths by his hand, she attacks him verbally to the point where he drops his normal carefree demeanor.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h5><b>History</b></h5>
            <p>Kanao lived an impoverished lifestyle before she was taken in by Kanae and Shinobu. Her parents were incredibly abusive towards her and her siblings, beating them and drowning them if they did anything they disliked. She broke psychologically, becoming an empty shell who was sold off into slavery.</p>
            <p>As she was being led off, tied around the waist by a rope held by her purchaser, they were approached by the Kocho sisters. After confirming she was a slave, Shinobu distracts the man by flinging money in the air. When he releases the rope in surprise, she grabs it, and the sisters escape with Kanao to the Butterfly Estate.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the sisters discover the extent of her trauma, which makes Shinobu view her as useless, if not potentially dangerous. Kanae, unperturbed, gives Kanao a coin and instructed her to flip it if she ever needs help making a decision.</p>
            <p>
              After Kanae was killed by Doma, Kanao was at her grave with the rest of the members of the Butterfly Estate. Although she was disturbed by her own inability to cry at her beloved sister's death, nobody judged her for it.

            <div>
              <a href="tanjirokamado.html" class ="font">Kamado Tanjiro</a>
              <p>She takes a special interest in Kamado. Thanks to his positive interaction she is slowly opening up. It is hinted at, in an extra chapter, that he will become her "special someone" (aka love interest).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <a href="kanae.html" class ="font">Kanae Kocho</a>
              <p>Kanae took an interest in Tsuyuri when she saw her being led away as a slave on the bridge. Along with her sister Shinobu, they purchased Tsuyuri from her master and trained her within the Butterfly Estate. Kanae was the person who gave Tsuyuri the coin she uses to make decisions whenever she is indecisive.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <a href="shinobu.html" class ="font">Shinobu Kocho</a>
              <p>Shinobu was originally against taking Kanao in due to her indecisive nature. Initially, she saw her as a useless, if not dangerous, person. After Kanae's death, she was responsible for helping her and entrusted her with avenging Kanae's death while using herself as a decoy.</p>
              <p>
                Even though their revenge goes as planned, Kanao is nonetheless filled with hatred and spite towards Doma. After she and Inosuke Hashibira kill Doma for good, she fishes through the water to find Shinobu's hairpin as a keepsake of her departed sister.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <a href="doma.html" class ="font">Doma</a>
              <p>Much like Shinobu, Kanao held strong resentment and hatred towards the Upper Moon Two for killing Kanae. This grudge grew even deeper after Doma devoured Shinobu following their duel, even if it was part of their plan for revenge.</p>
              <p>
                Kanao takes immense pleasure and satisfaction at calling Doma out on his inner "emptiness" and non-existent emotions, taunting him by asking him why he was even born and why he continued to bother living if he couldn't feel anything like a normal person would.

            <h5><b>Abilities and Power</b></h5>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p><strong>Breath of Flower Style (花はなの呼こ吸きゅう Hana no kokyū?)</strong> is a breath style derived from the Breath of Water, taught by Kochou Kanae, a former Hashira.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. <strong>Second Form: Plum Spirit (弐にノ型かた 御み影かげ梅うめ Ni no kata: Mikage Ume?)</strong> - A defensive techniques that deflects attacks using rotating sword slashes. </li>
            <li>2. <strong>Fourth Form: Crimson Hanagoromo (肆しノ型かた 紅べに花はな衣ごろも Shi no kata: Beni Hanagoromo?)</strong> - A single sword slash that curves and twists. </li>
            <li>3. <strong>Fifth Form: Peony of Futility (伍ごノ型かた 徒あだの芍しゃく薬やく Go no kata: Ada no Shukuyaku?)</strong>  - A graceful flurry of nine consecutive attacks that flow and weave in on themselves. </li>
            <li>4. <strong>Sixth Form: Swirling Peach (陸ろくノ型かた 渦うず桃もも Roku no kata: Uzumomo?) </strong> A technique used after or during evasion, the user spins around moving with their bodyweight to deliver an attack.</li>
            <li>5. <strong>Final Form: Scarlet Spider Lily Eyes</strong> - A focussing technique that raises the users kinetic vision to its maximum, while using this technique the user perceives the world as if it were in slow motion. Usage of the technique however is highly dangerous, as the tremendous strain caused to the eyes ruptured blood vessels and could cause partial or complete blindness.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div><h6 style="font-weight:normal;">Natural Abilities</h6></div>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Superhuman Eyesight</strong> - Kanao possesses extremely sharp eyesight, being able to accurately predict her opponent's next attack and movements by simply observing the subtle shifts of their muscles, joints and the slight movements of their eyes. This allows her to make effective counterattacks and dodges and stay ahead of her opponents.The Upper Moon Two, Doma, complements on this feat and remarks that due to this skill, Kanao may be more skilled than Shinobu.</p>

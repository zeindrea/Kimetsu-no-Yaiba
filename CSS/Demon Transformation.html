<p style="font-family:verdana;font-size:20px;">When Nezuko is under the dire situation, she could transform into a berserk-like state, with vines tattoos circling her body, her veins popping out and a single horn protruding from her right forehead side. This form enhances Nezuko fighting ability, at the cost of her becoming more demon-like, including the need to feed on humans blood. So far, the only way she could revert back to normal is to have someone (in her case, Tanjiro) sing her a lullaby. During the demon slayers fight against Hantengu, Nezuko manages to control this form at will.</p>
